## About me

With a strong foundation in Python and Rust, and a passion for high-performance computing and cloud technologies, I’m dedicated to creating efficient, scalable, and innovative software solutions. My work spans from numerical computing to cloud-based architectures, always pushing the boundaries of performance and reliability.


## What I Do

🐍 Python Expertise: I leverage Python for building everything from data pipelines to automation scripts and back-end services.

⚙️ Rust for Performance: I’ve developed a Rust crate for numerical integration, taking advantage of Rust's memory safety and performance optimizations. Rust's speed and concurrency features make it ideal for computationally intensive tasks.

🌩 Cloud-Native Development: My cloud skills revolve around designing and deploying highly available, scalable systems using AWS. I’m experienced with AWS Lambda for serverless functions and AWS Step Functions for orchestrating complex workflows.

🚀 High-Performance Computing (HPC): My research in HPC focuses on maximizing computational efficiency. I’m constantly exploring new ways to optimize code performance, whether for machine learning models, data processing, or complex simulations.

## My Goals

✨ Continuous Learning in HPC and Rust: I’m committed to staying at the cutting edge of high-performance computing by deepening my expertise in parallel computing, distributed systems, and low-level optimizations with Rust and CUDA.

☁️ Build Scalable Cloud Solutions: I aim to continue leveraging cloud technologies like AWS to create robust, secure, and scalable systems that can handle the demands of modern software applications.

📈 Explore Efficient Numerical Computing: As a developer passionate about numerical computing, I’m constantly experimenting with new methods and libraries to improve the accuracy and speed of mathematical computations in software projects.

## Outside of Work

When I’m not optimizing software or designing scalable cloud solutions, you might find me:

🏊‍♂️ Swimming laps, as I enjoy the discipline and focus that swimming brings, helping to clear my mind and recharge for solving complex technical challenges.

🌱 Experimenting with hobby projects, where I enjoy testing out new programming languages or concepts.
